# Motivation
I recently started to study more serious topics like Machine Learning and Data Science. To
accomplish the objectives that I've settled in my mind, first I started with the Data Science series by HarvardX. 
I just finished the first course "R Basics", before moving on to the next course, Data visualization, I wanted to practice a little bit what I've learned. For a while I wanted to explore the kaggle datasets and now seems the perfect opportunity to make it so. 
# Disclaimer
As my knowledge on the topic, R and Machine Learning, is yet supperficial, I've found a great resource to follow and perhaps explore a little bit more, you can find it all here http://trevorstephens.com/ .

# Kaggle Titanic Dataset

#### First attempt
The most basic guess you could make is that they all died, and that was my first attempt, and guess what, it scored 62.679%.
